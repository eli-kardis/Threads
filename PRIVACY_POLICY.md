# Privacy Policy for Threads to Notion Sync

**Last Updated: December 9, 2024**

## Overview

Threads to Notion Sync ("the Extension") is a Chrome browser extension that helps users synchronize their Threads posts to Notion databases. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What We Collect
- **API Tokens**: Threads Access Token and Notion Integration Secret are stored locally in your browser
- **Synchronization History**: Records of synced posts (post IDs, titles, timestamps) are stored locally
- **User Preferences**: Your sync settings and field mappings are stored locally

### Where Data is Stored
All data is stored **locally on your device** using Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` API. **We do not have access to your data, and no data is sent to our servers.**

## Data Usage

Your data is used solely for:
1. Authenticating with Threads and Notion APIs
2. Syncing your Threads posts to your Notion database
3. Displaying sync history and statistics in the extension

## Third-Party Services

The Extension communicates with:
- **Threads API** (graph.threads.net): To fetch your posts
- **Notion API** (api.notion.com): To create pages in your database

These services have their own privacy policies:

- [Notion Privacy Policy](https://www.notion.so/Privacy-Policy-3468d120cf614d4c9014c09f6adc9091)

## Data Security

- No analytics or tracking is implemented

## User Rights

You have full control over your data:
- **Access**: View all stored data through Chrome's developer tools
- **Delete**: Use the "Reset Settings" button to clear all stored data
- **Export**: Sync history can be viewed in the extension dashboard
